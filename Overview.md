# AI Japanese Reader & SRS — Architecture & Context Guide
**Version: 1.1**

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the application's architecture, file structure, and core module responsibilities. It is designed to give a developer full context for working on any part of the app, including the mini-game ecosystem, without needing prior knowledge of the codebase.

## 1. Application Purpose & Key Features

AI Japanese Reader & SRS is a comprehensive, browser-based language learning application designed for Japanese students. Its primary goal is to make vocabulary acquisition engaging and effective through a suite of integrated tools.

The application is built around four core user-facing features:

*   **AI Story Reader:** Generates interactive, level-appropriate short stories using AI. As the user reads, they can tap on words to see definitions and save them to their personal study deck. The user's choices influence the direction of the narrative.

*   **Spaced Repetition System (SRS):** A classic, Tinder-style flashcard system for efficiently memorizing vocabulary. It uses a modified SM-2 algorithm to schedule reviews, ensuring words are practiced just before they are forgotten.

*   **Word Trainer:** A curriculum-based mode for building vocabulary from the ground up. Users select themed word lists (e.g., JLPT N5, Anime, Tourist) and learn them in a ranked, sequential order with AI-generated example sentences.

*   **Mini-Games:** A suite of diverse games (Tower Defense, RPG, Idle Clicker, etc.) that use the player's vocabulary as a core game mechanic. These games make reviewing learned vocabulary fun and engaging, providing an alternative to traditional flashcards.

All features are unified by a central vocabulary database (`srs_db.js`), allowing words learned in the Story Reader to appear in the SRS deck and be practiced in the Mini-Games.

## 3. Architectural Overview

*   **Technology**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES Modules), HTML5, CSS3. No frameworks.
*   **Architecture**: Single Page Application (SPA). `app.js` manages "views" (full-screen sections) by toggling their `display` property.
*   **State Management**: `localStorage` for all user settings, story data, and game saves. `IndexedDB` is used exclusively for caching TTS audio blobs.
*   **AI Backend**: Google Gemini API, accessed directly from the client. `ai_api.js` includes logic for key rotation to handle API rate limits.
*   **Modularity**: Each primary feature is managed by its own set of dedicated modules. UI logic (`_ui.js`) is generally separated from data/state logic (`_mgr.js` or `_db.js`).

## 4. Mini-Game Vocabulary System

All mini-games share a common vocabulary layer. No game module ever imports `srs_db.js` directly. The chain is always:

```
game module → GameVocabManager → srs_db
```

### 4.1 Core modules

**`game_vocab_mgr.js` — `GameVocabManager`**
The single vocabulary brain for all games. Responsibilities:
- Selects the next quiz word (`getNextWord()`) using one of three pedagogical modes: `auto`, `manual`, or `random`.
- Records answers and updates SM-2 scheduling state (`gradeWord()`).
- Operates in two scheduling modes: **Local** (self-contained SM-2, progress exportable) and **Global** (delegates directly to `srs_db`, answers affect the player's main flashcard reviews in real time). The mode is set automatically via the `globalSrs` flag in `setPool()`.
- Exposes static helpers that games must use instead of touching storage directly: `loadSrsPool()`, `defaultConfig()`, `configLimits`.

**`game_vocab_mgr_ui.js`**
Drop-in UI components built on top of `GameVocabManager`. Use these unless a game has a deep custom visual theme that would be lost:
- `showStandardQuiz(vocabMgr, options)` — single flashcard question in a modal overlay.
- `showQuizSequence(vocabMgr, count, options)` — multi-question sequence (e.g. a boss chest).
- `renderVocabSettings(vocabMgr, container, onSave)` — full settings panel (mode selector, thresholds, SM-2 params). **Always prefer this over handwriting your own settings UI.** Any new config field added to `GameVocabManager` will appear here automatically.
- `injectVocabBadgeStyles()` — injects the shared `.gvm-badge-real` / `.gvm-badge-rainbow` CSS. Call once at UI init for games that implement a custom quiz UI and don't call `showStandardQuiz`.

**`vocab_selector.js`**
Standalone UI for letting the player pick which word deck to use before a game starts. Mount it with `mountVocabSelector(container, options)`, then call `selector.getQueue()` to retrieve the chosen pool and pass it to `vocabMgr.setPool()`. Call `getDeckConfig(screenEl)` to snapshot the selector's current state for persistence; pass this snapshot back as `preloadConfig` when remounting to restore the player's last selection.

### 4.2 The three pool sources and their data flows

The player picks a word source in `vocab_selector.js`. What that choice means for where data lives and when `srs_db` is updated differs significantly between the three cases. **This distinction is critical — get it wrong and you will either silently skip SRS updates or overwrite the player's real review schedule unexpectedly.**

---

#### A. Pure SRS Pool (`deckId: 'srs'` only, `globalSrs: true`)

The player enabled "My SRS Vocabulary" and selected no custom word-list decks.

- `setPool()` is called with `{ globalSrs: true }`.
- Every answer goes **directly and immediately** to `srs_db` via `srsDb.gradeWordInGame()`.
- Nothing is written to the game's local save (`_meta.vocabState` is never populated).
- `exportToAppSrs()` at session end is a **no-op** — data is already live.
- The Learning Mode setting (auto / manual / random) is **greyed out** in `renderVocabSettings` because the SRS schedule controls word selection, not the game's local engine.

**Free review** (`type === 'free'`): when no cards are currently due, `srsDb.getNextGameWord()` returns `type: 'random'`. `GameVocabManager` re-labels this `'free'`. The quiz still runs, but:
- A **correct** answer does **not** update the SRS interval (it's a bonus round).
- A **wrong** answer **does** update the interval (you clearly still need to learn it).

The quiz UI should signal this state visually. Use `.gvm-badge-rainbow` on the quiz badge for free reviews and `.gvm-badge-real` for scheduled reviews — these classes are injected by `injectVocabBadgeStyles()` and are intentionally owned by `game_vocab_mgr_ui`, not by individual game stylesheets.

---

#### B. Pure Custom Deck (word-list decks only, `globalSrs: false`)

The player selected only word-list decks (Anime, JLPT N5, etc.) with no SRS toggle.

- `setPool()` is called **without** `{ globalSrs: true }` (default is `false`).
- A **fully self-contained SM-2 engine** runs inside the game. `srs_db` is never touched during the session.
- All scheduling state lives in the game's own save slot, serialised via `vocabMgr.exportState()` into e.g. `_meta.vocabState`.
- At session end, `exportToAppSrs(null, 'skip')` **pushes newly learned words into the app-wide SRS** using the `'skip'` policy — words already in `srs_db` are not overwritten; only genuinely new words are added. Pass `'overwrite'` instead if your game tracks mature intervals that should replace the existing ones.
- The Learning Mode setting is fully active — `auto`, `manual`, and `random` all function normally.

This is the correct mode for a "learn a new deck" flow where you want the player to build up local progress before committing anything to their main review schedule.

---

#### C. Mixed Pool (SRS words + custom deck words, `globalSrs: true`)

The player enabled both the SRS toggle and at least one word-list deck.

- `setPool()` is called with `{ globalSrs: true }` because the pool contains at least one `deckId: 'srs'` word.
- `isGlobalSrs === true` and `_hasCustomWords === true` simultaneously.
- Word selection routes through `srsDb.getNextGameWord()` for the entire combined pool.
- **Every answer for every word — including custom deck words — is written to `srs_db` immediately.** A custom deck word that the player answers correctly gets added to and scheduled in the app-wide SRS on the spot. There is no local buffer.
- `exportToAppSrs()` at session end is a **no-op** (same as pure SRS).
- The Learning Mode setting is active and applies to the combined pool.

**Key implication:** mixed mode is a fast way to bulk-add custom deck words to the player's main SRS, because each correct answer registers them. If you want custom words to stay local until the player explicitly exports them, use a pure custom deck instead.

`renderVocabSettings` reflects the current state automatically:
- Pure SRS → shows "Global App SRS Active" notice, greys out Learning Mode.
- Mixed → shows "Mixed Pool Active" notice, Learning Mode active.
- Pure custom → shows Local SM-2 parameters (interval, ease), Learning Mode active.

#### Summary table

| Pool source | `globalSrs` | SRS updates | Local save written | Export at session end |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SRS only | `true` | Live, every answer | Nothing | No-op (already live) |
| Custom deck only | `false` | Never during session | Full SM-2 state in `vocabState` | New words pushed via `'skip'` |
| Mixed | `true` | Live, every answer (incl. custom words) | Nothing | No-op (already live) |

### 4.3 Standard game lifecycle

```js
// 1. Construct — use GameVocabManager.defaultConfig() as the base
const mgr = new GameVocabManager({ mode: 'auto', ...savedConfig });

// 2. Load pool — never read srs_db or localStorage directly
const pool = GameVocabManager.loadSrsPool();   // player's SRS library
mgr.setPool(pool, 'my_game_banned', { globalSrs: true });

// 3. Seed (auto mode only — no-op for globalSrs or random)
mgr.seedInitialWords(5);

// 4. Quiz loop
const challenge = mgr.getNextWord();           // { refId, type, wordObj, options, correctIdx }
const result    = mgr.gradeWord(challenge.refId, isCorrect);

// 5. Pause / resume around any blocking UI
mgr.pause();   // freezes the SM-2 clock
mgr.resume();

// 6. Session end — export local progress back to app SRS
// No-op when globalSrs is true — safe to call unconditionally.
mgr.exportToAppSrs(null, 'skip');
```

### 4.4 Config persistence pattern

Games that expose vocab settings should store the config inside their own save object and use `GameVocabManager.defaultConfig()` as the fallback:

```js
_meta.vocabConfig = savedConfig || GameVocabManager.defaultConfig();
const mgr = new GameVocabManager(_meta.vocabConfig);
```

On save, use `renderVocabSettings`'s `onSave` callback to mirror the updated `vocabMgr.config` back into `_meta.vocabConfig`, then persist to `localStorage`. Do not hardcode clamp limits — read them from `GameVocabManager.configLimits`.

Games must also persist the **pool source** alongside the vocab config so the settings label ("Currently: Your SRS library") survives page reloads. Store it in `_meta.poolSource` and restore the runtime variable from it in `loadMeta()`. See `survivor.js` for the reference implementation.

### 4.5 Reference implementation

**`games/survivor/survivor.js`** is the canonical example of how to integrate `GameVocabManager` in a full-featured game. It demonstrates:
- Building and rebuilding the manager around a run lifecycle (`_buildVocabMgr` / `returnToCamp`).
- Persisting `_poolSource` in `_meta` so the settings label is correct after a page reload.
- Saving a `deckConfig` snapshot from `getDeckConfig()` and passing it as `preloadConfig` to `mountVocabSelector()` so the player's last vocab selection is restored.
- Calling `setPool()` inside `_getOrCreateVocabMgr()` (not just at run start) so `isGlobalSrs` and `_hasCustomWords` are correct whenever `renderVocabSettings` is opened between runs.
- `importState` / `exportState` for persisting SM-2 progress between sessions (Local mode only).
- Delegating the settings panel to `renderVocabSettings` while keeping game-specific settings (audio, deck picker, danger-zone resets) in the game's own overlay.
- Doing the lifetime stat rollup from `vocabMgr.getStats()` once at run-end (`showGameOver`) rather than accumulating per-answer.

**`games/survivor/surv_ui.js`** shows the correct pattern for a game with a **custom quiz UI** that doesn't use `showStandardQuiz` — keeping the `getNextWord → render → gradeWord` call pattern identical to the standard components while preserving game-specific visual theming. It calls `injectVocabBadgeStyles()` at init and applies `gvm-badge-rainbow` / `gvm-badge-real` to signal free vs. scheduled reviews.

### 5.7. Mini-Game Infrastructure

See **§ 4** for the full vocabulary system architecture. Summary of the infrastructure files:

*   **`games_ui.js`**: The "Games" tab main menu and game loader. Maintains the `GAME_REGISTRY` and handles the `init()` and `launch()` lifecycle of each game.
*   **`vocab_selector.js`**: Reusable deck-picker UI for a game's setup screen.
*   **`game_vocab_mgr.js`** & **`game_vocab_mgr_ui.js`**: The vocabulary brain and its standard UI components. **This is the most important context for a game developer** — read § 4 before touching any game's vocab code.

### 5.8. The Mini-Games (`main/js/games/*`)

*   **`caro/`**: A simple self-rating swipe game.
*   **`memory/`**: A classic card-matching game with a cosmetic shop.
*   **`tbb/`**: **Turn-Based Battle.** An RPG where vocab quizzes are attacks/defenses.
*   **`eu/`**: **Vocab Universalis.** A grand strategy map-painting game.
*   **`vocabcraft/`**: A tower defense game where vocab answers generate resources.
*   **`survivor/`**: **Yōkai Survivor.** A Vampire Survivors clone where leveling up triggers vocab quizzes. **Canonical reference implementation** for `GameVocabManager` integration — see § 4.4.
*   **`neko/`**: **NekoNihongo.** An idle clicker where vocab reviews are timed events that boost production.

### 5.9. Data & Assets

*   **`main/data/*.js`**: Raw JavaScript arrays of vocabulary words.
*   **`main/styles.css`**: Global styles. Games inject their own scoped styles into the `<head>`.
*   **`main/sw.js`**: Minimal service worker to enable PWA installation.

## 6. Developer Cheatsheet: Working on a Game

**Example Task: Add a new feature to the "Neko" game.**

1.  **Locate the Files:** The primary logic is in `main/js/games/neko/neko.js`.
2.  **Understand the Lifecycle:** `games_ui.js` calls `neko.init()` once, then `neko.launch()` every time you open it. The game's main loop and UI rendering happen inside `neko.js`.
3.  **Handle Vocabulary:** Follow the standard lifecycle in § 4.2. In brief:
    *   Mount `vocab_selector.js` on the setup screen to let the user pick a deck.
    *   Create a `GameVocabManager` using `GameVocabManager.defaultConfig()` as the config base.
    *   Call `mgr.setPool(queue, 'neko_banned')` with the selected words.
    *   When a quiz moment arrives, call `mgr.getNextWord()` then `mgr.gradeWord(refId, isCorrect)`.
    *   For the settings UI, call `renderVocabSettings(mgr, container, onSave)` — do not write your own.
    *   See `games/survivor/survivor.js` for a complete worked example (§ 4.4).
4.  **Manage State:** Read your game's save data from `localStorage` at the start of `launch()` using a game-specific key (e.g., `neko_nihongo_save`). Call your `saveGame()` function periodically, which should include `savedData.vocabState = vocabMgr.exportState();`.
5.  **Styling:** Inject a `<link>` or `<style>` tag with CSS classes prefixed with your game's abbreviation (e.g., `nk-` for Neko) to prevent collisions with other games or the main app.

---

## 7. GameVocabManager — Full API Reference & Patterns

This section is self-contained. It gives a new game developer everything needed to wire up vocabulary correctly without needing to read `game_vocab_mgr.js` or study survivor's source.

### 7.1 Constructor & config

```js
import { GameVocabManager } from '../../game_vocab_mgr.js';

// Always start from the canonical defaults, then overlay your saved config.
// Never hardcode default values yourself — they may change.
const mgr = new GameVocabManager({
    ...GameVocabManager.defaultConfig(),
    ...savedVocabConfig,   // from your game's localStorage save, may be empty/undefined
});
```

`GameVocabManager.defaultConfig()` returns:

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `mode` | `'auto'` | `'auto'` \| `'manual'` \| `'random'` — see § 7.3 |
| `initialInterval` | `8` | Seconds before a newly introduced word reappears (Local mode) |
| `initialEase` | `1.5` | SM-2 ease multiplier — higher means intervals grow faster |
| `leechThreshold` | `20` | Wrong-answer count before a word is flagged as a leech |
| `autoNewWordBatchSize` | `1` | Words introduced per auto-event |
| `minDueTime` | `10` | Seconds with no due cards before auto-introducing a new word |
| `minAccuracy` | `0.80` | Recent accuracy (0–1) required before auto-introducing |

When clamping user input in a settings UI, use `GameVocabManager.configLimits` instead of hardcoding ranges:

```js
const { min, max } = GameVocabManager.configLimits.autoNewWordBatchSize; // { min: 1, max: 5 }
value = Math.max(min, Math.min(max, rawInput));
```

### 7.2 Loading and setting the vocab pool

```js
// ── Option A: player's own SRS library (Pure SRS) ──────────────────────────
const pool = GameVocabManager.loadSrsPool(); // reads srs_db; never touch localStorage directly
mgr.setPool(pool, 'mygame_banned', { globalSrs: true });
// Every answer updates srs_db in real time.
// exportToAppSrs() at session end is a no-op — data is already live.

// ── Option B: custom word-list deck only (Pure Custom) ─────────────────────
const selector = mountVocabSelector(containerEl, { bannedKey: 'mygame_banned' });
const queue    = await selector.getQueue();
mgr.setPool(queue, 'mygame_banned'); // no globalSrs flag → defaults to false
// Self-contained SM-2; srs_db is never touched during the session.
// Call exportToAppSrs(null, 'skip') at session end to push new words to the app SRS.

// ── Option C: mixed — SRS words + custom deck words ─────────────────────────
// queue contains words with both deckId:'srs' and deckId:'anime' (for example).
mgr.setPool(queue, 'mygame_banned', { globalSrs: true });
// CAUTION: globalSrs:true applies to the whole pool.  Custom deck words are also
// written to srs_db immediately on answer — there is no local buffer.
// Use this intentionally (fast bulk-enroll into the app SRS), not by accident.
// exportToAppSrs() is a no-op.

// ── After setPool, seed an initial hand (Local / auto mode only) ───────────
// No-op in random mode or globalSrs mode — safe to call unconditionally.
mgr.seedInitialWords(5);
```

See **§ 4.2** for the full breakdown of what each pool source writes, where, and when.

### 7.3 Pedagogical modes

| Mode | Behaviour | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `'auto'` | SRS-ordered. New words introduced automatically when accuracy and idle-time thresholds are met. | Recommended default. |
| `'manual'` | SRS-ordered. New words only introduced when the player calls `learnNewWord()` explicitly. | Games with a deliberate "study" action (e.g. a library button). |
| `'random'` | Picks any word at random from the full pool. No SRS scheduling; `gradeWord()` still tracks stats but doesn't affect intervals. | Arcade modes, warmup rounds. |

### 7.4 The quiz loop

```js
// ── Pause the manager's SM-2 clock before showing any blocking UI ──────────
mgr.pause();

// ── Get the next challenge ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
const challenge = mgr.getNextWord();
// Returns null if the pool is empty or every word is in-flight.
// challenge shape:
// {
//   refId:      string,      // opaque token — pass back to gradeWord()
//   type:       string,      // 'due' | 'new' | 'drill' | 'leech' | 'random' | 'free'
//                            // 'free' = no cards due in the SRS; this is a bonus round.
//                            //   Correct answers do NOT update the SRS interval.
//                            //   Wrong answers DO (you still need to learn it).
//                            //   Signal 'free' visually — use .gvm-badge-rainbow on the quiz badge.
//   wordObj:    {            // the word to display
//     kanji:  string,        // the Japanese word (display as the question)
//     kana:   string,        // furigana / reading
//     eng:    string,        // the correct English translation
//   },
//   options:    string[],    // 4 shuffled English choices (includes the correct one)
//   correctIdx: number,      // index of the correct answer in options[]
// }

if (!challenge) { resumeGame(); return; }

showMyQuizUI(challenge.wordObj, challenge.options, challenge.correctIdx, (isCorrect) => {
    // ── Grade the answer ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
    const result = mgr.gradeWord(challenge.refId, isCorrect);
    // result shape:
    // {
    //   isCorrect:      boolean,
    //   combo:          number,   // current correct-answer streak
    //   newInterval:    number,   // seconds until next review (Local) or 0 (Global)
    //   isLeech:        boolean,  // is this word now flagged as a leech?
    //   justBecameLeech:boolean,  // true only on the answer that crossed the threshold
    //   isFreeReview:   boolean,  // true when challenge.type was 'free' (no due cards).
    //                             // Correct answers did NOT update the SRS interval.
    //                             // Useful for showing a "(no interval change)" notice in the UI.
    // }

    mgr.resume(); // always unpause after grading
    continueGame(result);
});
```

`gradeWord` also accepts a numeric SM-2 grade `0–3` instead of a boolean, for games that want finer control (`0`=blackout, `1`=hard, `2`=good, `3`=easy).

### 7.5 Using the standard quiz UI components

For games that don't need a custom visual theme, skip the quiz loop above entirely and use the drop-in components from `game_vocab_mgr_ui.js`:

```js
import { showStandardQuiz, showQuizSequence, renderVocabSettings, injectVocabBadgeStyles }
    from '../../game_vocab_mgr_ui.js';
```

For games that **do** implement a custom quiz UI (like Survivor), import and call `injectVocabBadgeStyles()` once at UI init. This injects the shared `.gvm-badge-real` (green, scheduled review) and `.gvm-badge-rainbow` (animated gradient, free review) CSS classes. Apply them to your quiz badge element based on `challenge.type === 'free'`. Do **not** define these styles in your game's own stylesheet — they belong to the GVM module.

```js
import { showStandardQuiz, showQuizSequence, renderVocabSettings }
    from '../../game_vocab_mgr_ui.js';

// ── Single question (e.g. on level-up) ────────────────────────────────────
mgr.pause();
showStandardQuiz(mgr, {
    container:    gameOverlayEl,    // overlay is appended here and removed on answer
    title:        '⚔️ Clash!',
    showFurigana: true,
    optionCount:  4,                // 2–9; actual count may be lower if pool is small
    onAnswer: (isCorrect, wordObj, result) => {
        mgr.resume();
        if (isCorrect) showUpgradeScreen();
        else           applyPenalty();
    },
});

// ── Multi-question sequence (e.g. boss chest requiring 3 correct) ──────────
mgr.pause();
showQuizSequence(mgr, 3, {
    container:    gameOverlayEl,
    title:        '🧰 Boss Chest',
    showFurigana: true,
    onComplete: (successes, failures) => {
        mgr.resume();
        if (failures === 0) openChest();
        else                consolationPrize();
    },
});
```

Both functions call `mgr.pause()` / `mgr.resume()` internally around each question, but you should still call `mgr.pause()` before invoking them so the clock stops before the UI appears.

### 7.6 Vocab stats — HUD display and end-of-session rollup

```js
const stats = mgr.getStats();
// {
//   correct:       number,  // total correct answers this session
//   wrong:         number,  // total wrong answers this session
//   combo:         number,  // current streak
//   highestCombo:  number,
//   accuracy:      number,  // recent accuracy (last 20 answers), 0–1
//   totalPoolSize: number,  // all words in pool
//   activeCount:   number,  // words that have been introduced (in SM-2)
//   newCount:      number,  // words not yet introduced
//   dueCount:      number,  // words currently due for review
//   leechCount:    number,  // words flagged as leeches
// }

// ── Example HUD bar ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
const s = mgr.getStats();
hudEl.textContent =
    `📚 ${s.activeCount} · 🎯 ${Math.round(s.accuracy * 100)}% · `
    + (s.dueCount > 0 ? `📬 ${s.dueCount} due` : '✓');

// ── End-of-session stat rollup ─────────────────────────────────────────────
// Read ONCE at session end, not per-answer. vocabMgr is the source of truth.
const final = mgr.getStats();
save.lifetime.totalCorrect += final.correct;
save.lifetime.totalWrong   += final.wrong;
save.lifetime.bestStreak    = Math.max(save.lifetime.bestStreak, myRunBestStreak);
```

### 7.7 Pause / resume

The manager maintains an internal SM-2 clock. Pausing it prevents words from becoming "due" while the game is blocked. Call `pause()` any time the game stops (overlay shown, app backgrounded, manual pause menu); call `resume()` when it unblocks.

```js
// Around any blocking overlay:
mgr.pause();
showMyOverlay(() => {
    mgr.resume();
});

// Around the entire app lifecycle if needed:
document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', () => {
    if (document.hidden) mgr.pause();
    else                 mgr.resume();
});
```

### 7.8 Manual word mode controls

In `'manual'` mode, new words must be introduced by the player. Expose a button (e.g. in a pause menu) that calls:

```js
const word = mgr.learnNewWord();
// Returns the introduced word object (truthy) if a new word was available.
// Returns false if the pool is exhausted (all words already introduced).
if (word) showFlash(`📖 New word: ${word.kanji}`);

// To show how many are left:
const { newCount } = mgr.getStats();
learnBtn.textContent = `📖 Learn New Word (${newCount} remaining)`;
learnBtn.disabled    = newCount === 0;
```

### 7.9 Saving and restoring state

Call `exportState()` before the session ends and `importState()` at the start of the next one. This preserves SM-2 intervals across sessions in Local mode.

```js
// ── Save (call before nulling the manager or on beforeunload) ─────────────
save.vocabState = mgr.exportState();
localStorage.setItem('mygame_save', JSON.stringify(save));

// ── Restore (call after constructing the manager, before setPool) ──────────
const save = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('mygame_save') || '{}');
const mgr  = new GameVocabManager({ ...GameVocabManager.defaultConfig(), ...save.vocabConfig });
if (save.vocabState) mgr.importState(save.vocabState);
mgr.setPool(pool, 'mygame_banned');   // importState must come before setPool

// ── Export to app SRS at session end (Local mode only) ────────────────────
// No-op if globalSrs is active — safe to call unconditionally.
mgr.exportToAppSrs(null, 'skip');
// 'skip'      → only adds words not already in the app SRS (safe default).
// 'overwrite' → updates existing entries; use if your game tracks mature intervals.
```

### 7.10 Settings UI

Always use `renderVocabSettings` rather than building your own panel. It renders into any container element and calls `onSave` when the player confirms:

```js
import { renderVocabSettings } from '../../game_vocab_mgr_ui.js';

// Render into a <div> inside your settings screen:
renderVocabSettings(mgr, settingsContainerEl, () => {
    // onSave: mirror the updated config back into your save object
    save.vocabConfig = { ...mgr.config, ...mgr.config.autoThresholds };
    localStorage.setItem('mygame_save', JSON.stringify(save));
    // If you reconstruct the manager at run start, null it here to force a rebuild:
    mgr = null;
});
```

The panel automatically shows/hides fields based on the current mode, displays the Global SRS notice when `globalSrs` is true, and respects `configLimits` for all inputs. Any new fields added to `GameVocabManager` in the future will appear in it automatically.
